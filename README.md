# 用户核心体验心流 (Core User Experience Flow)


### Phase 1: 触发与极简启动 (Trigger & Frictionless Start)
**User State:** 
* **Physical:** 晨僵 (Morning Stiffness) / 肌肉紧张 (Tension)
* **Mental:** 压力过大 (Stressed) / 决策疲劳 (Decision Fatigue)
  
**0门槛启动 (Zero Friction):**
    * 穿上即用 (Wear & Play) -> *解决 "Setup Friction" 痛点 (无需三脚架/吸盘)*
    * 无需订阅 (No Paywall)？ -> *解决 "Subscription Fatigue" 痛点 (心理零负担)*
    * *Marketing Hook:* "No playlists to manage. Just press play and let the science take over."

---

### Phase 2: 沉浸式共振 (The Resonance Phase)
**Device Output:** 
* **Audio:** 固定的节奏音乐 (Tuned BPM).
* **Haptics:** 与音乐 0延迟同步的穴位/肌肉震动 (0ms Latency Sync).

**The Experience:**
* **不需寻找节奏 (Don't find the beat):** 震动直接作用于身体，节奏在主动“引导”你。
* **感官占据 (Sensory Occupation):** 听觉与触觉的双重包裹感，强制大脑暂停焦虑，进入当下。
### A. 激流模式 (Active / Entertainment Flow)

* **交互 (Action):** * 跟随光效与震动击打 (Haptic Cues)。
    * **多巴胺释放 (Dopamine Hit):** 每一次击打都有即时的触觉反馈 (Instant Gratification)。
    * **忘我 (Flow State):** 音乐掩盖了运动的疲劳感 ("Music makes workout fly by")。
* **生理反应:** 心率提升 -> 出汗 (Sneaky Cardio) -> 肌肉激活。
---

### Phase 3: 双重释放路径 (Dual Release Paths)
*同一个程序，根据用户状态产生不同效果：*

**Path A: 被动唤醒 (The Passive "Thaw")**
* *场景:* 早上躺在床上 / 休息时。
* *机制:* 震动促进血液循环 (Micro-circulation) 。
* *结果:* **解冻 (Thawing):** 模拟针灸/理疗的神经刺激，僵硬的关节在音乐中不知不觉变软。血液循环加速 -> 晨僵缓解 (由60分钟缩短至10分钟) -> 神经系统镇静。

**Path B: 主动宣泄 (The Active "Flow")**
* *场景:* 站立 / 需要发泄时。
* *机制:* 强节奏激发运动本能 -> 跟随震动挥动/拍打。
* *结果:* **出汗 (Sweat):** 快速进入心流状态 (Flow State)，释放多巴胺，不知不觉完成有氧运动。

---

### Phase 4: 终局状态 (The Afterglow)
**状态：** 酣畅淋漓 (Sweaty) / 身体松弛 (Mobile)
* **情绪价值 (Emotional Release):**
    * "发泄感" (Whack-a-mole effect) -> 压力释放。
    * "成就感" (Gamification) -> 击败高分/完成连击。

**Physiological:** * 肌肉松弛 (Mobile) + 身体微热 (Warm).
**Psychological:** * 心情愉悦 (Dopamine High) + 压力重置 (Reset).

**Retention Loop:**
* "It felt like a game/massage, not a workout."
* **不枯燥 (Addictive):** 因为有趣所以坚持 -> *解决 "3-Exercise Rule" 依从性问题*。
* **生活回归 (Life Reclaimed):** 早上能更快出门上班 / 晚上能睡得更香。
