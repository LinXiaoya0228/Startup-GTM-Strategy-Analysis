*A comprehensive market analysis, commercial roadmap, and landing page implementation for a haptic wearable startup preparing for CES 2026 and global launch.*

## 📖 Executive Summary
**The Challenge:** A Shenzhen-based hardware startup developed a "haptic vest" with 12 vibration nodes but lacked a clear market fit. They initially targeted "general fitness," a saturated market with high customer acquisition costs.

**My Role:** As a Market Data Analyst & Frontend Contributor, I pivoted the strategy from "Fitness" to **"Somatic Wellness & Neuro-Engagement"**, identifying three unserved personas. I then engineered the **CES 2026 Landing Page** and a 6-month commercial roadmap spanning **CES (USA)** to **Kickstarter**, **Amazon**, and **618 (China)**.

## 🌐 Digital Execution: CES Landing Page
To capture leads at CES 2026, I co-developed a high-conversion Landing Page. I implemented a responsive design using **HTML5 & Tailwind CSS**, featuring custom-coded visual interactions to demonstrate the app interface.

## 📊 Market Analysis: The Pivot
> *See full analysis in [Market_Analysis_and_Personas.md](./Market_Analysis_and_Personas.md)*

By analyzing "frequency keywords" in reviews of competitors, I discovered that **"Morning Stiffness"** and **"Subscription Fatigue"** were the two biggest pain points.

| Competitor Weakness | Our Strategic Pivot |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Hardware as a Service"** (Monthly Fees) | **"One Price, Lifetime Access"** |
| **"Athletic/Aggressive"** Branding | **"Gentle/Somatic"** Branding for Aging Parents |
| **"Setup Friction"** (Tripods/Mounts) | **"Wear & Play"** (Zero Setup Friction) |

## 🗓️ Commercial Roadmap (Gantt Chart)
> *See detailed timeline in [Launch_Timeline.md](./Launch_Timeline.md)*

I designed a "Export-to-Domestic" strategy: Building brand equity in the US (CES + Kickstarter) to drive premium sales in China.
