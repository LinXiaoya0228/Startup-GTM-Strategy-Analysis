## Part 2: 用户体验流程 (User Experience Flow)

### Phase 1: 启动与连接 (Initiation)
* **状态 (State):**
    * *Physical:* 身体感觉沉重、僵硬 (Morning Stiffness) 或肌肉紧绷 (Tension)。
    * *Mental:* 精神游离、压力过载或缺乏动力。
* **动作 (Action):**
    1.  **穿戴:** 将磁吸模块吸附在衣物对应位置。穿上即用 (Wear & Play) -> *解决 "Setup Friction" 痛点 (无需三脚架/吸盘)*, 核心无需订阅
    2.  **激活:** 
* **反馈 (Feedback):** 设备瞬间响应，确认连接就绪。无屏幕干扰。

      
### Phase 2: 感官接管 (Sensory Takeover)
* **输入 (Input):** 设备开始播放预设的音乐。(No playlists to manage. Just press play and let the science take over.)
* **体验 (Sensation):**
    * *听觉:* 极简的节奏音乐响起 (Tuned BPM)。* 不需寻找节奏 (Don't find the beat): 震动直接作用于身体，节奏在主动“引导”你。
    * *触觉:* 震动与音乐节拍 **同步**。震动不再是单纯的物理撞击，而是音乐的实体化延伸 (Physicalized Sound)。
* **心理变化:** 注意力被迫从"焦虑/杂念"转移到"当前的节奏"上。大脑进入 **感官占据 (Sensory Occupation)** 状态，外界干扰消失 (心流)。

### Phase 3: 交互体验
* **用户动作:** 跟随光效或震动提示，进行拍打。
* **体感反馈:** 每一次动作都精准卡在震动点上，产生强烈的 **打击满足感**。(有即时的触觉反馈)
* **生理改变:** 心率跟随 BPM 提升。在音乐和震动的双重驱动下，身体不知不觉进入高强度运动状态，关节滑液分泌增加，肌肉温度升高，汗腺打开，内啡肽分泌。

### Phase 4: 状态重置 (State Reset)
* **结束 (Completion):** 音乐节奏逐渐放缓，震动转为长波舒缓模式，随后轻柔停止。
* **终局状态 (Afterglow):**
    * *身体:* 充满了通透感。僵硬消失，取而代之的是运动后的微热与松弛 (Mobile & Warm)。
    * *情绪:* "完成感"替代了"压力感"。多巴胺分泌带来平静的愉悦。
