## 3. Sentiment Analysis: Voice of Customer (VoC)

### 🔴 Pain Points (What they hate)
* **"Hardware as a Service":** 90% of negative reviews for competitors cite subscription fees. Users feel "held hostage" by hardware that stops working if they stop paying.
* **"The Morning Suck":** Chronic pain patients (RA/Lupus) lose the first 60 minutes of their day to stiffness.
* **"Setup Friction":** Users hate tripods, suction cups that fall, and complex app pairing. They want "Wear & Play."

### 🟢 Desires (What they want)
* **"Gamified Rehab":** Traditional physical therapy is boring. Users admit to "reward hacking" (faking progress). They need lights/sound (Dopamine) to stick to a routine.
* **"Zero Setup":** A device that is ready in seconds, ideal for small apartments.

## 4. Strategic Recommendations
1.  **Pricing Model:** **One Price, Lifetime Access.** No subscriptions. This directly counters the #1 market complaint.
2.  **Marketing Angle:** Pivot from "General Fitness" to **"Rhythmic Health"**—targeting the specific "Morning Stiffness" and "Somatic Release" use cases.
3.  **Launch Channel:** Kickstarter (March 10, 2026). Use the "Super Early Bird" ($199) to capture the price-sensitive "Gadget Hunter" segment.
